## Calculating Prime Number

This module covers calculating nth prime number. For demonstration n will be 25000 for all implementations.

1. Brute Force with Non-Optimized JS

Takes too much time as compared to languages like c and c++.

Execution time:

real	0m15.481s
user	0m15.539s
sys	    0m0.040s


2. Brute Force with Optimized JS

Better performance but still slower than c/c++.

Execution time:

real	0m1.591s
user	0m1.591s
sys	    0m0.012s


3. Optimized Algorithm with Optimized JS

Almost matches c/c++ execution time.

Execution time:

real	0m0.138s
user	0m0.136s
sys	    0m0.004s
