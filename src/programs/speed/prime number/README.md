## Calculating Prime Number

This module covers calculating nth prime number. For demonstration n will be 25000 for all implementations.

1. Brute Force with Non-Optimized JS

Takes too much time as compared to languages like c and c++.
Execution time = ~15 seconds

2. Brute Force with Optimized JS

Better performance but still slower than c/c++.
Execution time = ~3 seconds

3. Optimized Algorithm with Optimized JS

Almost matches c/c++ execution time.
Execution time = ~0.13 seconds
