## Calculating Factorial

This module covers up calculating factorial of a number, for comparison we'll use 171 for all examples. There will be 3 implementations of this:

1.Brute Force with Non-Optimized JS

This fails for any number above 170 since its above the JS number limit.

2.Brute Force with Optimized JS

This succeeds but nothing done for optimizing speed.

Execution time:

````
real  0m0.222s
user  0m0.226s
sys   0m0.004s
````


3.Optimized Algorithm with Optimized JS

This executes faster and shows correct value as well.

Execution time:

````
real  0m0.213s
user  0m0.194s
sys   0m0.028s
````

A very little improvement on speed but I'm still working on getting this faster. Also notice that this is more of a memory problem than speed.
