## Calculating Factorial

This module covers up calculating factorial of a number. There will be 4 implementations of this:

1. Brute Force with Non-Optimized JS

This fails for any number above 170 since its above the JS number limit.

2. Brute Force with Optimized JS

This succeeds but nothing done for optimizing speed.

3. Optimized Algorithm with Optimized JS

This executes faster and shows correct value as well.
