This modules covers programs that require efficient memory usage.

## Tips for efficient memory usage.

### General 

1. Prefer storing primitives instead of objects.
2. Use strings to represent large number that may result in infinity otherwise. 
3. Delete objects whenever possible if any doubt of memory leaks. 


### Arrays

1. Avoid using nested arrays, instead represent them as as array of primitives.
